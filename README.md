These are chapter-wise Jupyter Notebooks from the book "Robotics, Vision and Control 2nd Edition" by Peter Corke. Third edition of the book does come with a Python toolbox instead of MATLAB one previously; nevertheless, it's fun to write these functions myself with basic tools.

### Dependencies
```console
pip install matplotlib numpy scipy sympy
```
